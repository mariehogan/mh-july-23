### My Goal: Make a Calendar Using the calendR Package

A secondary goal is to continually commit and push my changes to a Github repository as practice.

```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
library(calendR)
library(lubridate)
```

#### The default calendar from calendR looks like this

```{r}
calendR()
```

I don't like this. I want a dateless calendar for tracking work progress. I also want it to be prettier. I am using [this r-coder tutorial](https://r-coder.com/calendar-plot-r/) as my resource for customization.

#### Customizing the Date Range

```{r}
#start calendar today
starting_day <- today()
#end a week from today
ending_day <- today() + weeks()
#generate calendar
calendR(start_date = starting_day,end_date = ending_day)
```
